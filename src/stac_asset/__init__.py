"""Read and download STAC items, item collections, collections, and assets.

The core class is :py:class:`Client`, which defines a common interface for
accessing assets. There are also some free functions, :py:func:`download_item`
and :py:func:`download_item_collection`, which provide simple one-shot
interfaces for downloading assets.

Writing items, item collections, collections, and assets is currently
unsupported, but is on the roadmap.
